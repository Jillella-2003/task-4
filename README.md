## 📋 Description

This project is developed as part of **Task 4: Advanced Features and Testing** for the 45-Day Android Internship at **ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd.**

The goal of this task was to integrate advanced Android features such as user authentication, session handling, and push notifications, while ensuring the app remains stable and user-friendly.

### ✅ Features Implemented:

- 🔐 **Login functionality** with input validation
- 💾 **Session management** using `SharedPreferences`
- 📱 **Push notification** shown upon successful login (using `NotificationCompat`)
- 👋 **Dashboard screen** after login, with logout functionality
- 🔁 **Logout clears session** and navigates back to the login screen
- 🧪 **Tested** for empty fields, invalid inputs, and session flow

This task helped me understand how to implement core Android app behaviors such as authentication, session persistence, UI navigation, and local notifications — all crucial for real-world app development.
